A Look at the Irish Property Rental Market
===========

This a data visualisation that uses d3js, and boostrap to illuminate the publically available dataset published by the PTRB.

The current version is the first wroking draft and needs to be refactored and rationalised.

It based on two tutorials:
* Mike Bostock's  [Letâ€™s Make a Map.](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/)
*Jim Vallandingham's  [How to Make Interactive Linked Small Multiples.](http://flowingdata.com/2014/10/15/linked-small-multiples/)
